This website is meant to inform the user about computers and what components make them up. On the website, the user can view individual pieces of the computer and learn about them via a short description. A user can also find an informational video on how to build their own computer. A user is also able to provide feedback to help us improve the website.

The user can create data for the database when they register for an account and also when they leave a comment for feedback. The application reads data when the user attempts to login. On the feedback page, a user also has the ability to update their comments or completely delete them.
